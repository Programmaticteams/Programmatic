# How was Programmatic created?

As you know, Programmatic is a non-profit organization to teach kids how to code. but what you don't know is how we set all of this up

## coming up with the idea

we always wanted to do stuff in computer science. In our first year of high school, we all volunteered at a company that teaches kids how to code. After our first year, we saw that the company didn't offer everything we wanted to teach, so we decided to start our own non-profit and named it Programmatic. The name came from combining the words programming and problematic.

## Setting up the website

After we came up with a name, we started to set up the website. We used GitHub pages to host the website and started programming it in HTML, CSS, and javascript. We used Bootstrap to help speed up CSS programming.

1. Main page:
   The main page is the first page that people see when they go to our website. It has a navbar in the center and an animation that happens whenever you hover a different item on the navbar. The animation is composed of an image that goes up as you hover over the lower items and a gradient that goes down as you hover over the lower items. We
   used javascript to get all the items in the navbar, put them into an array, and then whenever an item hovers, We assigned that item data active index to the item position in the array. Then We used CSS to make the picture go up and the gradient go down based on the current active index.
2. About page:
   The about us page was the easiest to make because it's only text and images. First, We put a background image over the entire page. Then We put a div with a black background color and low opacity over the page to help make the text easier to read. Lastly, We just added a div with the text.
3. our team page:
   Our team page was the hardest to make because of the cards. The cards are composed of a picture and a name. And when hovered over a description and a learn more button. The cards were made entirely using HTML and CSS and then positioned using Bootstrap so that the cards move when the screen size changes instead of becoming smaller.
4. enroll page:
   The enrollment page also took a lot of work because of the cards. Unlike our team page, the enroll page has more cards than you can fit into one row and also need to be easily changed so we can add more courses in the future. We used Bootstrap to make sure the cards won't become smaller and then used multiple media queries so that the cards will be in the right place when the screen size changes.

   There were many errors along the way, but we eventually got everything to work. After we finished the main part of the website, we got a domain name and set it up with GitHub pages. We also made Google forms to collect information from people who wanted to sign up for our classes.

### Setting up the articles

After we got a domain, we started to work on the articles page. We used markdown to write the articles. We used javascript to put all the articles in an array and then into a div. Using This method allowed us to easily add articles without having to change the HTML code.
