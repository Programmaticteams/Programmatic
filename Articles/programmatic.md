# How was Programmatic created?

As you know, Programmatic is a non-profit organization to teach kids how to code. but what you don't know is how we set all of this up

## coming up with the idea

we always wanted to do stuff in computer science. In our first year of high school, we all volunteered at a company that teaches kids how to code. After our first year, we saw that the company didn't offer everything we wanted to teach, so we decided to start our own non-profit and named it Programmatic. The name came from combining the words programming and problematic.

## Setting up the website

After we came up with a name, we started to set up the website. We used GitHub pages to host the website and started programming it in HTML, CSS, and javascript. We used Bootstrap to help speed up CSS programming. There were many errors along the way, but we eventually got it to work. After we finished the main part of the website, we got a domain name and set it up with GitHub pages. We also made Google forms to collect information from people who wanted to sign up for our classes.

## Setting up the articles

after we got a domain, we started to work on the articles page. We used markdown to write the articles. We used javascript to put all the articles in an array and then into a div. Using This method allowed us to easily add articles without having to change the HTML code.
